# Introduction to GitHub administration

## GitHub Administration at team level

GitHub enables users to form teams within organizations, granting more precise repository permissions and fostering communication.

Teams aid in refining permissions and communication among members. Synchronization with identity provider (IdP) groups like Azure AD automates updates, reducing manual tasks. Azure AD facilitates onboarding, permissions, and access management.

Team maintainers/admins can:

- Create, rename, delete teams.
- Manage members, sync with IdP groups.
- Add outside collaborators.
- Enable/disable discussions.
- Adjust team visibility.
- Handle code review assignment.
- Set reminders and profile picture.


## Best practices for team-level administration
Creating teams within organization on GitHub offers collaboration flexibility and simplifies repository and permission management. Best practices for team setup include:

1. **Nested Teams:** Reflect organization's hierarchy with nested teams within GitHub organization.

2. **Interest-Based Teams:** Create teams based on interests or specific technologies (e.g., JavaScript, data science) to streamline PR reviews. Members can join based on their skills and interests.

3. **Team Synchronization:** Enable synchronization between identity provider (IdP) and GitHub. This lets owners and maintainers link GitHub teams with IdP groups. Synchronization automates updates, reducing manual work. IdP synchronization helps manage tasks like onboarding, permissions, and access removal.

## Administation at organization level
GitHub organizations provide collaborative spaces for users to work on multiple projects concurrently. Owners and administrators wield robust security and administrative tools to manage member access and repository data.

Owners in an organization enjoy comprehensive privileges, including:

- Inviting and removing users from the organization.
- Creating and supervising teams, designating "team maintainers" among members.
- Adding external collaborators to repos.
- Assigning repository permissions and default levels.
- Establishing organization security.
- Managing billing and assigning billing managers.
- Gathering repository data with custom scripts.
- Implementing organization-wide changes through custom scripts.

It's advisable to have just one organization; creating multiple organizations poses challenges:

- Duplication and configuration sharing aren't possible, leading to repeated setup and potential errors.
- Additional costs might arise for applications installed across multiple organizations.
- Managing multiple organizations is generally more complex.

## Administration at enterprise level
Enterprise accounts encompass GitHub Enterprise Cloud and Enterprise Server instances, providing centralized policy and billing management for multiple organizations.

At the enterprise level, owners with appropriate permissions can:

- Implement SAML single sign-on for the enterprise, linking external identities via an identity provider (IdP) to GitHub accounts.
- Manage enterprise organizations by adding or removing them.
- Set up billing or assign a billing manager for all organizations in the enterprise.
- Set up policies for repository management, project boards, teams, and security settings that apply across the enterprise's organizations, repositories, and members.
- Gather organization data using custom scripts.
- Implement enterprise-wide changes, such as migrations, using custom scripts.

## GitHub authentication options
GitHub offers various authentication methods and security features:

1. **Authentication Options:**
    - Username and password (basic authentication) can be used, but other options are recommended for enhanced security.
    - Personal access tokens (PATs) serve as password alternatives for API and command-line interactions.
    - SSH keys enable remote server authentication, eliminating the need for tokens or passwords.

2. **SSH Keys:**
    - Users can generate SSH keys to authenticate to remote servers and services without tokens or passwords.
    - the SSH key should be added the ssh-agent and GitHub account.
    - Keys can also be used with SAML single sign-on (SSO) and SSH certificates.

3. **Deploy Keys:**
    - SSH keys specific to a single repository for read or write access.
    - Deploy keys are read-only by default, but they can get write access when adding them to a repository

4. **Security Options:**
    - Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security via a generated code. Organization owners can require organization members, outside collaborators, and billing managers to enable two-factor authentication for their personal accounts, making it harder for malicious actors to access an organization's repositories and settings. Enterprise owners can also enforce certain security policies for all organizations owned by an enterprise account.
    - SAML SSO offers centralized identity management and access control. GitHub offers limited support for all identity providers that implement the SAML 2.0 standard with official support for several popular identity providers including:
        - Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
        - Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
        - Okta
        - OneLogin
        - PingOne
    - LDAP integrates GitHub Enterprise Server with existing user directories. GitHub Enterprise Server integrates with popular LDAP services like:
        - Active Directory
        - Oracle Directory Server Enterprise Edition
        - OpenLDAP
        - Open Directory

## Repository permission levels

Customize repository access by assigning five levels of permissions:

- **Read:** For viewing and discussing projects, recommended for non-code contributors.
- **Triage:** Allows issue and pull request management, suitable for non-writers like project managers.
- **Write:** Standard permission for active contributors who push to the project.
- **Maintain:** Enables repository management without destructive actions, suitable for project managers.
- **Admin:** Full access, including sensitive actions like security management, for repository owners and administrators.

Assign different access levels to members, collaborators, and teams within your organization. Select the appropriate level based on roles, ensuring no unnecessary access.

## Team permission levels
Teams simplify assigning repository permissions to multiple users. Child teams inherit parent team permissions, facilitating cascading permissions based on company structure.

Team Level Permissions:

| Permission Level | Description                    |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Member           | Same abilities as org members  |
| Maintainer       | All member abilities, plus:    |
|                  | Change team details            |
|                  | Manage parent/child teams      |
|                  | Set team profile picture       |
|                  | Edit/delete team discussions   |
|                  | Add/remove org members         |
|                  | Promote members to maintainers |
|                  | Remove team's repo access      |
|                  | Manage code review assignment  |
|                  | Manage PR scheduled reminders  |

Organization owners can promote org members to team maintainers.

## Organization permission levels

There are multiple levels of permissions at the organizational level:

| Permission Level | Description|
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Owner                  | Full authority, including adding/removing users.                              |
| Member                 | Can create and manage repositories and teams.                                 |
| Moderator              | Controls non-member contributors, sets limits, and manages comments.          |
| Billing Manager        | Manages viewing and editing of billing information.                           |
| Security Manager       | Manages security alerts, settings, and reads permissions for all repositories.|
| Outside Collaborator   | Access to organization repositories without formal membership.                |



You can set default permissions for all org members:

- None: Clone/pull public repos. Add to teams for more access.
- Read: Clone/pull all repos.
- Write: Clone/pull/push all repos.
- Admin: Full access, add new collaborators.

For better management, consider default read access and adjust permissions case-by-case. For small orgs or trusted members, granting more access upfront may be suitable.

## Enterprise permission levels
There are three levels of permission at the enterprise level:

| Permission Level   | Description                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Owner              | Full control, manage admins/orgs/settings |
| Member             | Same abilities as org members             |
| Billing manager    | View/edit billing, add/remove managers    |

You can set default repo permissions across your orgs:

- No policy: Orgs set defaults.
- Admin: Clone/pull/push/add collaborators.
- Write: Clone/push/push all org repos.
- Read: Clone/pull all org repos.
- None: Clone/pull public repos.

For better management, consider default read access and adjust permissions case-by-case. In a small enterprise, you might trust all with write access.


## Repository Security and Management

To enhance the security and management of your repositories, consider the following actions:

- Create Protection Rules:
    - Enforce specific workflows by establishing branch protection rules.
    - Rules can include requiring a pull request before merging, passing status checks, resolving conversations, using signed commits, maintaining a linear history, enforcing a merge queue, ensuring successful deployments before merging, and locking branches to make them read-only.
    - Additional options allow restricting who can push to matching branches.

- Add a `CODEOWNERS` File:
    - Introduce a `CODEOWNERS` file to your repository.
    - Assign team members or entire teams as code owners responsible for specific code.
    - When someone modifies code owned by a designated code owner, that owner is automatically requested as a reviewer.
    - The `CODEOWNERS` file can be placed in the root repository, `docs`, or `.github` folder of the repository.

Additionally users can track traffic by using `Insights`. Anyone who has push access to a repository can view its traffic. In the traffic graph, they can view full clones (not fetches), visitors from the past 14 days, referring sites, and popular content. To access the trafic graph: 
1. navigate to `github.com`
2. Go to the main page of repository
3. Select `Insights` tab
4. Select `Traffic` tab

Optionally, you can select Clones or Views to see the traffic graph for clones or views.
