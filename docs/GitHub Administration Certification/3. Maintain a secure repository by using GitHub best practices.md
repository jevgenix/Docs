# Maintain a secure repository by using GitHub best practices


## How to maintain a secure GitHub repository

In today's landscape, the security of applications is paramount. News often highlights breaches where systems are compromised, resulting in the theft of private data from companies and customers.

To establish a solid secure development strategy, several aspects must be considered. Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access is crucial. Equally important is safeguarding data from inappropriate changes or destruction and ensuring proper disposal.

Validating user identity and permissions is essential. Historical data and logs are vital for tracing issues when they arise.

Key Considerations for Secure Application Development:

1. **Constant Learning:** Security is an evolving domain. Ongoing education and training are necessary, as many assume understanding without staying updated.

2. **Proper Coding:** Code creation must prioritize both correctness and security. Security-centric design of features is vital.

3. **Regulatory Adherence:** Compliance with rules and regulations is imperative. Continuous testing for compliance during development and post-deployment is vital.

Security integration can't be an afterthought. It must be integrated throughout the software life cycle, especially for critical and sensitive applications.

Shifting security left in the development process is crucial. Developers need security feedback early to prevent errors and expedite development.

A Shift Left Approach:

- **GitHub Security Policy:** A SECURITY.md file in repositories helps responsible disclosure of security concerns, speeding up resolutions.
  
- **GitHub Security Advisories:** Privately addressing and disclosing vulnerabilities assists the community in staying updated.
  
- **.gitignore:** Ignoring sensitive files using .gitignore minimizes risks of inadvertent exposure.

- **Sensitive Data Removal:** Developers must be vigilant about removing sensitive data from repositories.

- **Branch Protection Rules:** Enforcing workflows, reviews, and tests for protected branches enhances code quality.
  
- **CODEOWNERS File:** Assigning code ownership to team members or groups for specific files ensures thorough reviews.

Incorporating security from the outset reduces rework and accelerates software development. It's about embedding security throughout the process, making security a shared responsibility across teams.

## Detecting and Fixing Outdated Dependencies with Security Vulnerabilities

External package dependencies are commonplace. While they boost productivity, they can also introduce security risks. Managing these dependencies and their vulnerabilities can be time-consuming, especially considering their nested dependencies. GitHub offers tools to alleviate this burden.

### Repository Dependency Graphs

Every repository benefits from dependency graphs. GitHub scans common package manifests like `package.json` and `requirements.txt`, allowing project owners to track dependencies recursively.

### Automated Dependency Alerts

GitHub's automated alerts monitor dependency graphs, cross-referencing target versions with known vulnerabilities. When risks are identified, the project is alerted using GitHub Security Advisories.

### Automated Dependency Updates with Dependabot

Dependabot automates responses to alerts by generating pull requests for package updates. Contributors validate and merge these updates seamlessly.

### Automated Code Scanning

Similar to Dependabot, code scanning identifies vulnerabilities and errors within a GitHub repository's code. It helps fix existing issues and prevents new security problems. CodeQL empowers custom queries for tailored scanning.

Enable code-scanning alerts and workflows in a repository's security tab.

### Secret Scanning

GitHub's secret scanning detects known secrets or credentials in repositories to prevent fraud and secure sensitive data. It's enabled by default in public repositories and can be activated by administrators for private repositories.

When secret scanning detects credentials, GitHub informs the issuing service provider for validation and appropriate action based on associated risks.
