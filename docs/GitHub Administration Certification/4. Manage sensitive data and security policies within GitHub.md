# Manage sensitive data and security policies within GitHub

## 1. Setting Security Policies
- Implement security policies at various levels: repository, organization, or enterprise.
- Owners can manage access control, including enterprise-wide restrictions.
- Purpose of documentation and security settings: standardization, compliance, and prevention.
- Permission levels: None, Read, Write, Admin.
- Configuring permissions: 
    - For organization: `Settings` > `Your organization`
    - For enterprise: `Your enterprise` > `Policies` > `Repository policies`
- Configuration limited to GitHub Enterprise administrators and organization owners.

## 2. Documentation
- Creation of default health files when starting a new repository.
- Additional default community health files:
  - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  - FUNDING.yml
  - Issue and pull request templates and config.yml
  - SECURITY.md
  - SUPPORT.md
- GitHub enforces specific naming schemes for these files.
- Files contain information about security readiness, key contacts, and project background.
- Default files used if no repository-specific file exists in root, `.github`, or `docs` directories.
- SECURITY.MD is primary for security communication, includes:
  - Supported project versions
  - Reporting security vulnerabilities
  - Possible additional information like compliance and risks.

## 3. Security Advisories
- Comprehensive security advisories include:
  - Affected product and version
  - Severity
  - Addressed security weaknesses
  - Impact, patch status, and workarounds.
- Administrators publish security advisories.

## 4. Scrub Sensitive Data
- Automation:
  - Pre-commit hooks
  - Popular pre-commit hooks: Gitleaks, detect-aws-credentials, detect-private-key, secret_filename.
- Removing files from history:
  - `git filter-repo` command
  - `BFG Repo-Cleaner` open source tool
- Both tools rewrite history, changing SHAs of altered commits and dependent commits.
- Changed SHAs can affect open pull requests.
- Recommend merging or closing open pull requests before removing files.
- GitHub support can assist in removing confidential info.

## 5. Reporting and Logging
- Log records capture organizational actions:
  - Repository, user, action, location, date, time.
- Access log through GitHub.com, GHES, or GitHub AE (past 90 days).
- GraphQL API retrieves filtered info (past 120 days):
  - Access and permission changes
  - Admin promotions
  - GitHub App permission changes
- REST API retrieves info (past 90 days):
  - Monitors similar actions as GraphQL API
  - Git events logged for 7 days
- Generate audit reports:
  - Export audit logs from `Settings` > `Your organization` > `Audit log`
  - Use qualifiers for filtered results.
