## GitHub Features Licensing and Pricing

GitHub offers different features with varying licensing and pricing structures. Some features are available depending on the product type, while others are "rate-based," requiring payment for additional usage.

### Licensing for Metered Products

- GitHub Actions is free for public repositories and self-hosted runners.
- For private repositories, each GitHub account has a certain number of free minutes, based on the product used.
- A spending limit of $0 prevents additional usage beyond your limit.
- Overages are billed if the spending limit is increased.
- Windows and macOS runners consume minutes at different rates than Linux runners.

| Operating System | Minute Multiplier |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Linux            | 1                 |

| Windows          | 2                 |

- Free minutes reset monthly.

### Licensing GitHub Packages
