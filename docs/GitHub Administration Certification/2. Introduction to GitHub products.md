## GitHub Billing and Payments Overview

### Billing Structure
- GitHub bills separately for each account, including personal, organization, or enterprise accounts.
- Each account's bill is a combination of charges for subscriptions and usage-based billing.

### Subscriptions
- **Description:** Subscriptions cover the account's plan (e.g., GitHub Pro or GitHub Team) and consistent monthly costs for paid products (e.g., GitHub Copilot, apps from GitHub Marketplace).
- **Example:** GitHub Pro includes 3,000 free minutes of GitHub Actions usage each month.

### Usage-Based Billing
- **Description:** Applied when the cost of a paid product depends on usage metrics, such as the minutes your jobs spend running or storage your artifacts use.
- **Example:** GitHub Actions usage beyond the included 3,000 minutes in GitHub Pro can be controlled by setting spending limits.

**Note:** Your plan may include certain amounts of usage-based products, and you can manage usage beyond included amounts by setting spending limits.
