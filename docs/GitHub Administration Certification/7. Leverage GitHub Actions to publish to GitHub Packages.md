# Manage GitHub Actions in the Enterprise

## At Enterprise Level
### Configure a GitHub Actions Use Policy
- Workflows may contain custom actions.
- Use a policy to prevent malicious third-party actions.
- Options in Enterprise Cloud or Enterprise Server with GitHub Connect.
- Navigate to Enterprise account > Actions > General.
- Configure policy options:
    - Enable for all organizations.
    - Define restriction levels for GitHub Actions.

### Manually Sync Public Actions for Enterprise Server
- GitHub-authored actions bundled with Enterprise Server.
- Automatic access from GitHub Marketplace or manual sync.
- Browse official actions: [https://HOSTNAME/actions](https://HOSTNAME/actions).
- Use actions-sync tool for stricter control.

## At Organization Level
### Document Corporate Standards
- GitHub Actions workflow involves multiple files and repositories.
- Document corporate standards:
    - Repositories for storage.
    - Files/folders naming conventions.
    - Location of shared components.
    - Plans for ongoing maintenance.
    - Contribution guidelines.

### Create Workflow Templates
- Workflow templates for automation reuse.
- Users with write access to `.github` repository can create templates.
- Steps to create a workflow template:
    1. Create a `yml` workflow file.
    2. Create a `json` metadata file.
        - Must have the same name with `.properties.json` extension. 
            - For example, a file named `octo-organization-ci.properties.json` contains the metadata for the workflow file named `octo-organization-ci.yml`
        - Place in a public `.github` repository in the `workflow-templates` directory.
    3. Example workflow file:
         ```yaml
         name: Octo Organization CI

         on:
           push:
             branches: [ $default-branch ]
           pull_request:
             branches: [ $default-branch ]

         jobs:
           build:
             runs-on: ubuntu-latest

             steps:
               - uses: actions/checkout@v2

               - name: Run a one-line script
                 run: echo Hello from Octo Organization
         ```
    4. Example metadata file:
        ```json
        {
            "name": "Octo Organization Workflow",
            "description": "Octo Organization CI workflow template.",
            "iconName": "example-icon",
            "categories": [
                "Go"
            ],
            "filePatterns": [
                "package.json$",
                "^Dockerfile",
                ".*\\.md$"
            ]
        }
        ```
    5. Metadata parameters:

        | Parameter     | Description                                                  | Required |
        | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
        | name          | Name of the workflow template.                               | Yes      |
        | description   | Description of the workflow template.                        | Yes      |
        | iconName      | Defines an icon for the workflow's entry.                    | No       |
        | categories    | Defines the language category of the workflow.               | No       |
        | filePatterns  | Enables the template based on file patterns.                 | No       |

- For organization members: Actions > New workflow > Workflows created by _your_organization_name.


## Manage Runners
### Choose an appropriate runner for your workload
- **GitHub-hosted runners**
    - Receive automatic updates for OS, preinstalled packages, tools, and runner application.
    - Managed and maintained by GitHub.
    - Provide a clean instance for every job execution.
    - Use free minutes on GitHub plan.
- **Self-hosted runners**
    - Receive automatic updates for the self-hosted runner application only.
    - Can use cloud services or local machines.
    - Customizable to hardware, OS, software, and security requirements.
    - Don't need a clean instance for every job execution.
    - Free to use with GitHub Actions, but you're responsible for runner machines' cost.

### Configure access to self-hosted runners

- **Self-hosted runner groups**
    - Control access at organization and enterprise levels.
    - Useful for restricting access based on trust levels or mitigating security risks.
    - Create and manage groups at enterprise and organization levels.

### Configure self-hosted runners for enterprise use

- **Labels**
    - Default labels for OS and hardware architecture.
    - Custom labels for specific capabilities.
    - Useful for running jobs on runners with particular features.

- **Proxy servers**
    - Environment variables for proxy configurations.
    - https_proxy, http_proxy, no_proxy.
    - Set before configuring or starting the self-hosted runner application.

- **IP allowlists**
    - Add runner IP address or range to organization IP allowlist.
    - Navigate to organization settings > Organization security > IP Address.

#### Monitor and troubleshoot self-hosted runners
- **Steps for troubleshooting**
    - Check runner status in GitHub Actions settings.
    - Review activities and updates in `Runner_` files in `_diag` folder.
    - Review job status in `Worker_` files in `_diag` folder.

- **Additional steps based on OS**
    - **Mac**
        - Check the self-hosted runner application service using launchd.
        - If jobs require containers, ensure Docker is installed and running.
    - **Windows**
        - Check the self-hosted runner application service using `PowerShell`
    - **Linux**
        - Check the self-hosted runner application service using `journalctl`
        - If jobs require containers, check Docker installation and permissions using `systemctl`


## Manage Encrypted Secrets
### Organization Level
- Ensure security and minimize management overhead.
- Go to organization Settings.
- Select Secrets and variables > Actions > New organization secret.
- Enter name, value, and choose repository access policy.
- **Access:** Reference secrets in workflows.

### Repository Level
- **Scope:** Specific to a repository.
- Go to repository Settings.
- Select Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret.
- Enter name and value for the secret.

### Access in Workflows
- **Syntax Example:**
    ```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Hello world action
        with: 
          super_secret: ${{ secrets.SuperSecret }}
        env: 
          super_secret: ${{ secrets.SuperSecret }}
    ```

### Access in Actions
- **Syntax (action.yml) Example:**
    ```yaml
    inputs:
      super_secret:
        description: 'My secret token'
        required: true
    ```
- Read value using `$SUPER_SECRET` environment variable.

- **Warning:**
    - Avoid including encrypted secrets in action's source code.
    - Use the core module from the Actions Toolkit for secret usage in actions.
