    - May close tickets outside the scope or with unanswered attempts.
    - Reopening a ticket is possible upon request if closed due to a lack of response.

## Handling Changes in Organization Headcount
- A change in headcount, such as a new contractor partnership, can lead to increased friction.
- Administrator responsibilities include providing and revoking access, querying audit logs, and installing GitHub applications for standard workflows.

## Authentication with SAML SSO
- Administrators should enable SAML SSO for GitHub Enterprise organizations.
- SSO in GitHub Enterprise Cloud allows users to authenticate through their identity provider, centrally managed by organization owners and administrators.
- Identity providers like Okta streamline authentication, offering security benefits and centralized management.
- **Managing SAML Identities:**
    - Administrators can view and revoke a member's linked identity, active sessions, and authorized credentials.
    - Warning: Revoking SSO identity in organizations using team synchronization removes the person from mapped teams.

## Utilizing GitHub APIs for Administration
- **REST and GraphQL APIs:**
    - GitHub Enterprise Server supports REST and GraphQL APIs.
    - APIs automate administrative tasks, including changes to the Management Console, LDAP sync configuration, access changes for organization members, and monitoring enterprise account changes.
- **SCIM for Automation:**
    - System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) standard uses REST API and JSON requests to automate user provisioning and deprovisioning.
    - Compatible identity providers include Microsoft Entra ID and Okta.

- **GraphQL for Enterprise Account Management:**
    - Enterprise Accounts API and Audit Log API use GraphQL to monitor and make changes in organizations.
    - Relevant for security and compliance during growth periods.

## GitHub Applications and Actions
- **Automation with GitHub Applications:**
    - Install applications from GitHub Marketplace to automate complex actions.
    - Marketplace actions, when used appropriately, can integrate with external services and perform a series of automated tasks.

- **Contrast Between Actions and Applications:**
    - **Actions:**
        - Reusable scripts forming basic building blocks of workflows.
        - Execute simple responses to triggers.
        - Consume GitHub Actions minutes with limited repository access.
        - Managed by GitHub or user-controlled runners.
        - No user interface extension.
    - **Applications:**
        - More complex tools with greater functionality.
        - Consumed on a subscription basis.
        - Authorize an ongoing trust relationship with the application.
        - May have custom user interfaces.
        - Custom-built apps can use GitHub's REST and GraphQL APIs.

- **Locating Apps and Actions:**
    - **GitHub Marketplace Tips:**
        - App or Action: Determine if you need to automate a task (Action) or improve overall functionality (Application).
        - Budget Consideration: Filter by Free, Free Trials, GitHub Enterprise, and Paid options.
        - Specific Improvement Area: Utilize Categories for filtering based on business operation types.
        - CI/CD Improvements: Look for apps in the CI/CD category, considering paid options for enhanced functionalities.


## GitHub Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs) Administration
- GitHub Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs) are accounts owned by companies, not individual users.
- Controlled, managed, and audited by the companyâ€™s GitHub administrators.
- Connect GitHub Enterprise Account to identity providers (IdP) like Microsoft Entra ID or Okta.
- Admins have complete jurisdiction over EMU accounts and corresponding private repositories.
- **Administrative Control:**
    - EMU accounts' complete ownership lies with the company.
    - Administrators can grant EMU access to any organization within the enterprise.
    - Profile information control, including usernames, names, and emails, is managed from the connected IdP.

## Managed Users vs. Regular Users

- **GitHub Enterprise Managed Users (EMU):**
    - Owned and controlled by the identity provider.
    - Automated user provisioning syncs IdP group membership with GitHub teams.
    - Enterprise-level policies applicable to all EMU accounts.
    - Audit log available for all managed users' actions.
    - No public repositories on EMU-enabled enterprises.
    - True single sign-on (SSO) experience for users.
    - User metadata controlled by the enterprise.

- **GitHub Enterprise Account Users:**
    - Require multiple authorization and authentication initiatives.
    - Administrators manage user membership in GitHub teams.
    - Users confirm compliance with GitHub user policies.
    - Limited audit log activity available for review.
    - Enterprise users can create public repositories.
    - Multiple authentication steps required for signing on.
    - Users create their accounts with personal data.

## Authentication and User Provisioning

- **Provisioning with IdP:**
    - Provision user accounts directly from IdP.
    - Authentication requires SAML SSO.
    - User provisioning utilizes System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM).

- **IdP Communication:**
    - IdP communicates with GitHub.com for:
        - Assigning application to a user.
        - Updating user information.
        - Unassigning or deactivating user accounts.

## Use Cases for EMU Accounts
1. **Onboarding New Employees:**
    - Efficiently provision EMU accounts with required permissions.
    - Automatic flow in line with benefits, HR, and expense systems.

2. **Offboarding Employees:**
    - Instantly suspend GitHub accounts during employee exits.
    - Integrated with HR, email, internal documents, and benefits systems.

3. **IP Leakage Prevention:**
    - EMUs prevent accidental IP leakage when switching between projects.
    - Clearly identify the current account to avoid exposing IP to the wrong repositories.

4. **Consultant Administration:**
    - Grant consultants access through EMU accounts via IdP.
    - Automatic removal of access after project completion.
    - Tight control over source code and IP access, reducing accidental IP leakage.
