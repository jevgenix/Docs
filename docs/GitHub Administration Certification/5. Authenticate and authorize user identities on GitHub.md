# Authenticate and authorize user identities on GitHub

## Authentication and Access Control

- Controlling access to company data and applications is fundamental for enterprise security.

- GitHub Enterprise user experience starts with logging in.
- Users must authenticate by providing credentials (user name and password).
- Encourage users to enable 2FA for enhanced security.
- Challenge: Balancing ease of use with secure authorization processes.
- Setup should ensure user access ease under secure organizational requirements.

## Configuring Authentication
- Configuring authentication is the initial step for secure software development.
- SAML SSO is crucial for enterprise security strategy.
- Links IdP authorization with access to service providers.
- Users sign in to all applications with one set of credentials.
- Enterprise Admin authorizes user access and permissions.
- Important to limit user access to necessary resources.
- Admins handle routine audit events and maintain scoped access.
- Admins have an overview of every user's specific access.
- Easily export user access data to a CSV file.

## Configuring SAML SSO
- Configure SAML SSO with the chosen IdP.
- **Supported SAML IdPs:**
    - Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
    - Microsoft Entra ID
    - Okta
    - OneLogin
    - PingOne
    - Shibboleth
- Limited support for all IdPs implementing SAML 2.0.

## Access Management with Organizations
- **Multiple Organizations:**
    - Use organizations to manage distinct user groups.
    - Helpful for divisions or groups working on similar projects.
    - Public and internal repositories accessible to members of other organizations.
    - Private repositories accessible only to organization members.

## Organization Repository Types
- **Public Repositories:** Accessible to everyone on the internet.
- **Private Repositories:** Accessible only to the creator and explicitly shared users.
- **Internal Repositories:** Specific to organizations, accessible to certain members.

## Authentication Systems

- **Security as Top Priority:**
    - User authentication should prioritize strong security.
    - Monthly data breaches emphasize the importance of efficient security processes.

- **Recommended Authentication Methods:**
    - GitHub recommends SAML SSO and Multifactor Authentication (2FA).
    - Security professionals suggest various ways for user authentication.

## SAML SSO Authentication

- **Overview:**
    - SAML SSO verifies user identity against a known identity provider.
    - Link existing IdP to GitHub for user sign-in management.

- **Enforcing SAML SSO:**
    - Organization administrators can enforce SAML SSO authentication.
    - Setting: Your organizations > Settings > Organization security > Require SAML SSO authentication.

- **Enforcement Impact:**
    - Unauthenticated members will be removed from **Organization** after SAML SSO enforcement.
    - GitHub won't remove members from **Enterprise** who haven't authenticated with the SAML IdP yet.

## Multifactor Authentication (2FA)

- **Enhanced Security:**
    - 2FA adds an extra layer of security to GitHub Enterprise accounts.
    - Requires a secondary form of authentication in addition to username and password.

- **Enforcing 2FA:**
    - Organization administrators can require members to enable 2FA.
    - Non-compliant accounts will lose access to repositories:
        - `When you require the use of two-factor authentication for your organization, all accounts that do not use 2FA will be removed from the organization and lose access to its repositories. This includes bot accounts.`

- **Identification Options:**
    - Users can authenticate with `security keys`, `TOTP`, or `SMS`.
    - Security keys provide the highest level of security.

## 2FA Authentication Methods

- **Security Keys:**
    - High-security option, phishing-proof, and convenient.
    - Requires completion of `TOTP` or `SMS` authentication.

- **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password):**
    - GitHub recommends cloud-based `TOTP` apps for configuring 2FA.
    - More reliable than `SMS`, supports secure cloud backup.

- **SMS Authentication:**
    - Relies on the assumption that the user is the sole device holder.
    - Limited support, confirmation needed for certain countries/regions.

## 2FA Compliance Audit
- **Reviewing 2FA Compliance:**
    - Navigate to GitHub.com > Profile Photo > Your organizations > Organization Name > People tab > 2FA option.
    - Identify organization owners, members and outside contributors with enabled 2FA.

- **Revoking Access for Non-Compliance:**
    - Revoking access is possible for non-compliant users.
    - Communication outside GitHub through email notification is traditional.


## Authorization After Authentication
- Authorization is the next step after user authentication on GitHub.
- **SAML SSO and Access Control:**
    - Successful authentication through SAML SSO grants access to GitHub organizations.
    - Authorization is required for personal access tokens, SSH keys, and OAuth Apps.

## Authorization with SAML SSO through SCIM
- **SCIM Overview:**
    - SAML SSO allows control and secure access to organization resources.
    - SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) facilitates organization member access management.
- **SCIM Protocol:**
    - SCIM is a protocol for automating user identity information exchange.
    - Developed for synchronization between IdP and multiple applications.
- **Automatic Deprovisioning:**
    - SCIM integration enables automatic deprovisioning when sessions expire.
    - Authorized tokens retain access even after session expiration.

## SSH Key and PAT with SAML SSO
- **User Lifecycle Management:**
    - Changes in IdP reflected automatically in GitHub Enterprise.
    - Matching NameID and userName values link SAML authentication with SCIM identity.
- **Provisioning with SAML SSO:**
    - Changes to group membership trigger SCIM calls to update organization membership.
    - SAML assertion during resource access triggers provisioning.

- **API and Git Access:**
    - PAT or SSH key needed for API and Git access.
    - Administrators can review and manage user-authorized PATs and SSH keys.

## Adding New Members and Security Benefits
- **SAML SSO Activation:**
    - Multiple ways to add new members after enabling SAML SSO.
    - Manual invites, API usage, or using a specific URL for self-sign-up.
- **Security Benefits of SCIM and SAML SSO:**
    - GitHub records SAML SSO identity linked to GitHub account.
    - Review and manage linked SAML identity, active sessions, and authorized credentials.
    - Automated off-boarding process reduces administrator workload and minimizes errors.

## Connect Your IdP to Your Organization
- **Enabling SAML SSO and SCIM:**
    - Connection required between identity provider (IdP) and GitHub organization.
    - Supported IdPs for SCIM: Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, OneLogin.
- **GitHub Support Scope:**
    - GitHub provides technical support for listed providers.
    - Some issues may be out of scope, such as third-party integrations, hardware setup, and custom account synchronization.
- **Support Requests:**
    - Open a support ticket with GitHub for assistance in determining the scope of the issue.







## Team Synchronization with Microsoft Entra ID or Okta
- Team synchronization manages team membership through IdP groups.
- Suitable for enterprises using Microsoft Entra ID or Okta as IdP in GitHub Cloud.
- Changes in IdP groups are automatically reflected on GitHub.
- Reduces the need for manual updates and custom scripts.
- **Centralized user identity Management** for authorization, review, and permissions revocation.
