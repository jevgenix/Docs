# Leverage GitHub Actions to publish to GitHub Packages
GitHub Packages is a package-management service that simplifies the publishing of public or private packages alongside your source code.

## Key Points:
- **Package Registry Functionality:**
    - Share project dependencies within your organization or publicly.
    - Trust and understand code dependencies, connecting with the community that built them.
    - Find approved packages quickly within organizations.

- **Compatibility:**
    - Compatible with common package-management clients.
    - Supports various package types, allowing customization of publishing workflows.
    - Compatible with npm, NuGet, RubyGems, Maven and Gradle.

- **Container Registry:**
    - Functions as a container registry for distributing complete applications or CLI utilities.
    - Publish and distribute container images for use in various environments.

- **GitHub Packages vs. GitHub Releases:**
    - GitHub Packages is for publishing releases of libraries to package feeds or container registries.
    - GitHub Releases is for releasing bundled software with release notes and binary file links.

- **Unified Identity and Permissions:**
    - Enables the use of a single set of credentials across repositories and private registries.
    - Inherited visibility and permissions from the repository level.
    - Simplifies user credential management for multiple package types.

- **Integration with GitHub Actions:**
    - GitHub Actions automates software workflows, allowing building, testing, and deployment from GitHub.
    - Combining GitHub Actions and GitHub Packages streamlines the workflow for building, testing, and publishing code.

## GitHub Packages Workflow
- GitHub Packages allows secure publication and consumption of packages, enabling storage alongside code and sharing with teams or the open-source community. 
- GitHub Actions automates package-related tasks. 
- Below is a sample workflow publishing a Node.js package to GitHub Packages when a new release is created:

    ```yaml
    name: Node.js Package

    on:
    release:
        types: [created]

    jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
            with:
            node-version: 12
        - run: npm ci
        - run: npm test

    publish-gpr:
        needs: build
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
            with:
            node-version: 12
            registry-url: https://npm.pkg.github.com/
        - run: npm ci
        - run: npm publish
            env:
            NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
    ```

## Workflow Explanation:
1. **Workflow File Location:**
    - Workflow file must be in `.github/workflows` directory.
    - Suggested naming convention: `release-package.yml`.

2. **Workflow Actions:**
    - **Build Job (`build`):**
        - Installs dependencies and runs tests using npm.
    - **Publish Job (`publish-gpr`):**
        - Publishes the package to the GitHub Packages registry after a successful build.
        - Uses `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` for authentication.

3. **Workflow Execution:**
    - Triggers on the creation of a new release.

4. **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):**
    - GitHub Packages supports containers for managing the application lifecycle.
    - GHCR allows hosting and managing Docker container images.

5. **GHCR Commands Example:**
    - Authenticate: `echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin`
    - Tag and Push: `docker tag IMAGE_ID ghcr.io/OWNER/IMAGE_NAME:latest` and `docker push ghcr.io/OWNER/IMAGE_NAME:latest`

6. **Authentication in GitHub Actions:**
    - Use `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication in workflows.

GitHub Container Registry enables fine-grained permissions, allowing configuration within organizations or user accounts. It supports storing container images and setting permissions for access, including anonymous access for public container images. When authenticating in GitHub Actions, use `GITHUB_TOKEN` for both package registries and container registry.

## Authentication to GitHub Packages:
- **Prerequisites:**
    - GitHub username
    - Personal Access Token (PAT)
    - GitHub Packages endpoint for your package ecosystem

- **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):**
    - Generate a PAT via your GitHub profile settings.
    - Treat your tokens like passwords and keep them secret.

- **Log in to GitHub Packages:**
    - Authenticate in your package manager using the endpoint: `https://PACKAGE_TYPE.pkg.github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY`, where PACKAGE_TYPE is your package ecosystem.

- **Authentication Commands:**

    | Package Ecosystem | Command to Authenticate to GitHub Package                                                                      |
    |-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | NuGet             | `dotnet nuget add source https://nuget.pkg.github.com/OWNER/index.json -n github -u OWNER -p [Your PAT Token]` |
    | npm               | `bash npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com`                                                         |
    | RubyGems          | `echo ":github: Bearer GH_TOKEN" >> ~/.gem/credentials`                                                        |
    | Maven & Gradle    | Direct authentication while pushing                                                                            |

## Package Management:

- **Install a Package:**
    - Once authenticated, use the provided command on the package's home page based on your project environment.

- **Manage Packages:**

    1. **GitHub API and GraphQL API:**
        - Enables advanced integration scenarios.
        - Use GitHub's Webhook feature to trigger actions on package events.
        - Example: Automatically publish a Tweet or blog post on new package releases.

    2. **GitHub Actions for Automation:**
        - Utilize `delete-package-versions` action to prune the oldest package versions.
        - Streamline package management workflows using GitHub Actions.
