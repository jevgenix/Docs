###     Conditional keywords
- Developers can use and evaluate expressions. Expressions are commonly used with the conditional `if` keyword to determine whether or not a step should run. The following example shows how to use the `if` keyword to run a step only when the `github.event_name` is `push`:
    ```yml
        steps:
          - name: Run a one-line script
            if: github.event_name == 'push'
            run: echo "A ${{ github.event_name }} event occurred."
    ```

    Other example uses the `if` keyword to run a step only when the `github.ref` (the `branch` or `tag` <b>ref</b> that triggered the workflow run) matches `refs/heads/main`:
    ```yml
        name: CI
        on: [push]
        jobs:
          prod-check:
            if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
              steps:
                - name: Run a one-line script
                  run: echo "The ref is ${{ github.ref }}."
                  ...
    ```

    <b>`It's important to know that when using conditionals in your workflow, you need to use the specific syntax ${{ < expression > }}, which tells GitHub to evaluate an expression rather than treat it as a string.`</b>

- In order to run a workflow with more specific conditional, GitHub offers using a keyword like containes(), startsWith(), endsWith(), and more. For example the in order to execute workflow workflow if a 'stage' label is added to the pull request would be: 
  ```yml
    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'stage')
  ```

##### Note!
When it comes to variables, contitional keyword can be used only within the context variables or predefined workflow variables inside the `env:` attribute! More about it in next chapter: `Variables`
