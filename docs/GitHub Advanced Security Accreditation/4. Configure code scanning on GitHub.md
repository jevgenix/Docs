1. Describe code scanning
    - Uses CodeQL to analyze the code in a GitHub repository to find security vulnerabilities and coding errors
    - Available for all public repositories, and for private repositories owned by organizations where GHAS is enabled
    - If error is found, it will be displayed in the `Security` tab of the repository.
    - After error is fixed, GitHub will close the alert

2. About code scanning with CodeQL
    - Two main ways to use CodeQL analysis for code scanning:
        - Add the CodeQL workflow to your repository using `github/codeql-action` to run the CodeQL CLI
        - Run the CodeQL CLI directly in an external CI system and upload the results to GitHub
    - It treats code like data, allowing to find potential vulnerabilities in code with greated queries on that database to identify problems in the codebase.
    - CodeQL supports both compiled and interpreted languages:
        - C/C++/C#
        - Go
        - Java
        - JavaScript/TypeScript
        - Python
        - Ruby
    - Running code scanning with GitHub Actions will affect your monthly billing minutes. If you want to use GitHub Actions beyond the storage or minutes included in your account, you'll be billed for additional usage.


3. Contrast how to implement CodeQL analysis in a GitHub Actions workflow versus a third party continuous integration (CI) tool
    - Use code scanning API endpoints to create automated reports for the code scanning alerts in an organization or upload results generated using offline code scanning tools
    - Supported custom media type for the code scanning REST API is `application/sarif+json`
    - The data is formatted as SARIF version 2.1.0
    - endpoint can be `/analyses/{analysis_id}`. This endpoint includes additional data such as:
        - `github/alertNumber`
        - `github/alertUrl`
    - CodeQL can be used by:
        - public repositories that are maintained on GitHub.com
        - private repositories that are owned by customers with an Advanced Security license
    - CodeQL comes with a bundle. The bundle contains:
        - CodeQL CLI product
        - A compatible version of the queries and libraries from `github.com/github/codeql`
        - Precompiled versions of all the queries included in the bundle
    - GitHub recommends using CodeQL bundle as this ensures compatibility and also gives much better performance that a separate download of the CodeQL CLI and checkout of the CodeQL queries.
    - Configuring Code scanning with GitHub Actions:
        - To enable code scanning with a GitHub Actions, you must specify `upload-sarif` action, which is a part of the `github/codeql-action` repository. This workflow includes input parameters that you can use to configure the upload
        - The main input is `sarif-file`, which configures the file or directory of SARIF files to be uploaded.
        - The `upload-sarif` action can be configured to run when the `push` and `scheduled` event occures
        - An example configuration:
        ```yml
        name: 'Code Scanning : Upload SARIF'
        description: 'Upload the analysis results'
        author: 'GitHub'
        inputs:
          sarif_file:
            description: |
              The SARIF file or directory of SARIF files to be uploaded to GitHub code      scanning.
              See https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/       integrating-with-code-scanning/
              uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github#uploading-a-code-scanning-analysis-with-githu        b-actions
              for information on the maximum number of results and maximum file size        supported by code scanning.
            required: false
            default: '../results'
          checkout_path:
            description: "The path at which the analyzed repository was checked out. 
            Used to relativize any absolute paths in the uploaded SARIF file."
            required: false
            default: ${{ github.workspace }}
          token:
            default: ${{ github.token }}
          matrix:
            default: ${{ toJson(matrix) }}
          category:
            description: String used by Code Scanning for matching the analyses
            required: false
          wait-for-processing:
            description: If true, the Action will wait for the uploaded SARIF to be         processed before completing.
            required: true
            default: "false"
        runs:
          using: 'node12'
          main: '../lib/upload-sarif-action.js'
        ```
        - GitHub uses properties in the SARIF file to display alerts.
        - Code scanning uses fingerprints to prevent duplicate alerts.
        - SARIF files creqted by CodeQL include the fingerprint data in the `partialFingerprints` field.
        - SARIF upload supports a maximum of 5000 results per upload. Any results over this limit will be ignored. In order to fix it, the configuration should be updated to focus on results for the most important rules or queries.
        - For each upload, SARIF supports a maximum size of 10 MB for the gzip-compressed SARIF file
        -  You can also create a new workflow that uploads SARIF files after you commit them to your repository. This is useful when the SARIF file is generated as an artifact outside of your repository.
        - A second example of using SARIF files which generated outside repository:
        ```yml
        name: "Upload SARIF"
        
        // Run workflow each time code is pushed to your repository and on a schedule. 
        //The scheduled workflow runs every Thursday at 15:45 UTC.
        
        on:
          push:
          schedule:
            - cron: '45 15 * * 4'
        
        jobs:
          build:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            permissions:
              security-events: write
          steps:
            # This step checks out a copy of your repository.
            - name: Checkout repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - name: Upload SARIF file
              uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1
              with:
                # Path to SARIF file relative to the root of the repository
                sarif_file: results.sarif
        ```
        - To generate third-part SARIF file as part of CI workflow, you can add the `upload-sarif` action as a step after running CI tests. 
        - An example of uploading SARIF files generated as part of a CI workflow:
        ```yml
          name: "ESLint analysis"

        // Run workflow each time code is pushed to your repository and on a schedule.
        // The scheduled workflow runs every Wednesday at 15:45 UTC.
        on:
          push:
          schedule:
            - cron: '45 15 * * 3'

        jobs:
          build:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            permissions:
              security-events: write
            steps:
              - uses: actions/checkout@v2
              - name: Run npm install
                run: npm install
              // Runs the ESlint code analysis
              - name: Run ESLint
                // eslint exits 1 if it finds anything to report
                run: node_modules/.bin/eslint build docs lib script spec-main -f node_modules/@microsoft/eslint-formatter-sarif/sarif.js -o results.sarif || true
              // Uploads results.sarif to GitHub repository using the upload-sarif action
              - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1
                with:
                  // Path to SARIF file relative to the root of the repository
                  sarif_file: results.sarif
        ```
        - By default, the workflow file for the CodeQL code scanning is called `codeql-analysis.yml`.



4. Explain how to configure code scanning on a repository using triggering events
    - Configure frequency
        - scan on schedule
        - scan on push
        - scan on pull request
    - Define the secerities causing pull request check failure:
        - By default, onlt alerts with the severity level of `Error` or security level of `Critical` or `Hight` will cause a pull request check failure.
        - Pull request failure don't stop a code scan, but represent a blocker when trying to merge code.
        - This can be changed in `Settings` > `Security & Analysis` > `Code scanning` section
    - To avoid unnecessary scand of pull requrest, use `paths-ignore` keyword. For example to exclude .md and .txt files from being scanned:
    ```yml
    on:
       push:
          branches: [main, protected]
       pull_request:
          branches: [main]
          paths-ignore:
             - '**/*.md'
             - '**/*.txt'
    ```
