## Run keyword
The `run` keyword is used to execute the task. `run` keyword tells the job to execute a command on the runner. This keyword can be used to execute actions or script. For example in the snippet below, the `run` keyword executes the script called `build.sh`, which is defined inside the `./github/scripts/` directory.
```yml
jobs:
  example-job:
    steps:
      - name: Run build script
        run: ./.github/scripts/build.sh
        shell: bash
```
