1. Setting security policies:
    - Using policies, you can set security policies individually at each level of your control: repository, organization, or enterprise.
    - You can grant owners access control or make enterprise-wide access restrictions as admin.
    - Documentation and security settings have three purposes: standardization for consistent responses, compliance with industry-standard practices, and prevention of critical failure by defending against security breaches.
    - The permissions you can grant to users on each level of your control are:
        - `None`
        - `Read`
        - `Write`
        - `Admin`
    - This permissions can be granted:
        - For `organization`: `Settings` > `You organization`
        - For `enterprise`: `Your enterprise` > `Policies` > `Repository policies`
    - Only GitHub Enterprise administrators and organization owners can configure organization security settings.
    

2. Documentation
    - As administration, when you create a new repository, you start with creating certain default health files.
    - Other default community health files can be:
        - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
        - CONTRIBUTING.md
        - FUNDING.yml
        - Issue and pull request templates and config.yml
        - SECURITY.md
        - SUPPORT.md
    - GitHub considers these files to have specific purpose and requires to follow the listed naming scheme
    - GitHub will use and display these default files for any repository owned by the account that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:
        - The root of the repository
        - The `.github` directory
        - The `docs` directory
    - SECURTY.MD is primary document for communicating security information. It includes:
    - These files record information about: security preparation, key contacts, and the project background.
        - a list of supported versions of project
        - a way to report a security vulnerability
        - Also it may include:
            - Information about the project's complieance with key privacy and security laws
            - Technologies that administrators and stakeholderts use to secure information
            - Known risks
    
3. Security Advisories
    - Security advisories should be comprehensive and include:  
        - Protuct and version affected
        - Severity
        - Types of security weaknesses addressed by the project owners actions
        - Impact, status of patches, and workarounds
    - Administrators are responsible for publishing security advisories

4. Scrub sensitive data from a repository
    - Automation:
        - pre-commit hooks (scripts that Git executes prior to the commit event, to scan for sensitive data)
        - The most popular pre-commit hooks are:
            - Gitleaks
            - pre-commit plugins:
                - `detect-aws-credentials`
                - `detect-private-key`
                - `secret_filename`
    - Removing unwanted files from repository's history:
        - `git filter-repo` command
        - `BFG Repo-Cleaner` open source tool
    - Whether you choose `git filter-repo` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner`, a user that pushes a commit to GitHub containing sensitive data has already crossed an important line; the organization should consider that data to be compromised and change it immediately.
    - `git filter-repo` allows the removal of passwords or renaming of specific files or file sets.
        - The syntax is complex and it has strong risk of creating unforeseen problems in a repository's integrity, especially if its executed on Windows operating system.
    - `BFG Repo-Cleaner` is efficient and easy to use. It provides a set of default actions to choose from that match many common use canses related to sensitive data.
        - The tool is limited in its capabilities to these cases, giving you little opportunity to customize for unusual circumstances.
    - Both tools rewrire repository's history, which changes the SHAs for existing commits that you alter and any dependent commits
    - Changed commit SHAs may affect open pull requests in repository
    - GitHub recommend merging or closing all open pull requests before removing files from repository using these tools.
    - Using `BFG Repo-Cleaner`:
        - To remove file with sensitive data and leave latest commit untouched, run:
            - `bfg --delete-files YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA``
        - To replace all text listed in `passwords.txt`, wherever it can be fount in repository's history, run:
            - `bfg --replace-text passwords.txt`
        - After the sensitive data is removed, you must force push changes to GitHub:
            - `git push --force`
    - Using `git filter-repo`:
        - If you run `git filter-repo` after stashing changes, you won't be able to retrieve your changes with other stash commands. Before running `git filter-repo`, GitHub recommend unstashing and changes you've made. To unstash changes, run:
            - `git stash show -p | git apply -R`
        - Install latest release of the `git filter-repo` tool
        - Navigate into repository's local working directory
        - Run the following command:
            - `git filter-repo --invert-paths --path PATH-TO-YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA`
            - This command forces Git to process the entire history of every branch and tag
            - Remove the soecified file
            - Remove some configurations such as the remote URL stired in th `.git/config` file
            - Overwrute existing tags
        - Add file with sensitive data to `gitignore`
        - Verify the process
        - Force push changes to GitHub
            - `git push origin --force --all`
        -In order to remove the sensitive file from tagged releases, you will also need to force-push against Git tags:
            - `git push origin --force --tags`

    - GitHub support technicians can assist you with removing confidential information
    - For instance you might have removed sensitive data from a repository, however you need to make sure they don't appear in forks of that repository
    - Private information removal requests are appropriate for:
        - Access credentials
        - AWS tokens
        - Documentation (such as network diagrams or architecture)
        - Information related to and posing a security risk to you as an individual
    
5. Reporting and logging
    - log records are the information about actions that affect the organization including:
        - The repository in which the action was performed
        - The user that performed the action
        - The action that was performed
        - Which country/region in which the action took place
        - The date and time of the action
    - You can access the audit log using GitHub.com, GHES or GitHub AE to review actions from the past 90 days
    - You can use GraphQL API to retrieve filtered information from the past 120 days
        - GraphQL can monitor:
            - Access to your organization or repository settings
            - Changes in permissions
            - Added or removed users in an organization, repository, or team
            - Users being promoted to admin
            - Changes to permissions of a GitHub App
        - GraphQL cannot provide information about Git events
    - You can use REST API to retrieve information from the past 90 days
        - It monitor the same actions as the GraphQL API
        - Information about Git events only remains in the log for 7 days
    - Generate reports for auditing:
        - You can export audit logs in a common format by accessing the `Audit log` from the `Settings` sidebar in `You organization` by choosing the `Export` drop-down menu
        - You can filter the audit log results by adding a qualifier and accompanying value to the `Filters` field next to the `Export` drop-down menu. Qualifiers and example values:
            - `action`: `team.create`
            - `actor`: `octocat`
            - `user`: `codertocat`
            - `org`: `octo-org`
            - `repo`: `octo-org/octo-repo`
            - `created`: `2020-01-01`
